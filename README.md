# Yoga Hub
_“You are only one yoga class away from a good mood.”_

The web application was built as my third milestone project for Code Institute's Full Stack Software Development course. It is a full-stack site that allows its users to store and manipulate data records about a yoga domain. The topic for the project was chosen because of my own yoga journey and those of my fellow yoga teachers in training. The app was designed with me/us using it in the future in mind.

### Design

The site is designed with light theme in mind, characteristic for yoga studios and websites. 

* #### Colour Scheme
    The colour scheme is simple, using white background, and contrasting bright colors for most of its elements, including text. The scheme which served as an inspiration can be seen on [Coolors](https://coolors.co/b82677-a9d2cc-eb7545-f4f5f7-211f20).

* #### Typography
    Materilize's typography has been used throughout the site.

* #### Imagery
    Images of people in various yoga poses taking part in group classes have been used throughout the site to make the purpose of the website obvious and the site inspiring and esthetically pleasing.

## Notes on Development Process

* Trello Board has been used since the beginning of development to track progress, capture ideas, and make notes
![trello board](docs/readme-img/trello-board.jpg)

* MaterializeCSS was chosen as a responsive CSS framework, mostly due to learning purposes, as I have been using Bootstrap extensively in the past and wanted to compare those two. I also liked the resulting look, as well as was aware of Materialize's shortcomings (especially it not being actively maintained).

* Changes to design - Originally, Materialize's Collapsible element was chosen to display individual classes. I then decided to showcase the classes a little bit more and create larger cards with the classes details on them, including an image.

***
## Database Design

MongoDB was used to store data for this site in a database. The data has been set out in three collections - classes, users, styles. See an example below: 

**Collection: styles**

{<br>
    "_id": unique value,<br>
    "class_style":"Hatha"<br>
}

**Collection: classes**

{<br>
    "_id": unique value,<br>
    "class_name":"Morning Vinyasa Flow with Susie",<br>
    "class_style":"Vinyasa",<br>
    "description":"Start the day Vinyasa style!",<br>
    "date":"30 June, 2022",<br>
    "is_online":"yes",<br>
    "location":"Zoom",<br>
    "price":"12",<br>
    "contact":"susie@susie.ie",<br>
    "created_by":"susie",<br>
    "date_parsed":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1656547200000"}}<br>
}

**Collection: users**

{<br>
    "_id": unique value,<br>
    "username":"susie",<br>
    "password": unique value<br>
}

### Security

Database connection details are set up in an env.py for development, for security reasons this is not uploaded to GitHub so that database and connection details are not visible to users. In production these are stored in Heroku.

    * It takes an input from the user and searches the classes collection - specifically the class_name, description, and location fields.

* **Filter by yoga style functionality**
    * User can filter classes based on a yoga style of their choosing. This makes their classes lookup even easier.

* **Sorted by Date**
    * All yoga classes on the site are sorted by date in ascending order to make the lookup easier for the user.

* **Pagination**
    * Pagination is implemented on all pages (all classes display, search results, filtered results, collection of the logged in user's classes)

* **Add New Class**
    * Allows user to create a new class by filling in all the required fields.
    * There is front end as well as back end **validation** implemented on all the input fields. It also gives user a feedback in real time.

* **Custom 404 and 500 Error Pages**
    * To handle internal and not_found errors gracefully. 

* **Favicon**

* **The site is fully responsive**

### Features Left to Implement in the Future

* Create two types of users - teachers and regular users. (At the moment, there is no need for this.)
* Allow regular users to save events for themselves, so that they can access them easier in the future. Display these saved classes on their profile page.
* Further filters based on location, live/online events, teacher.
* Option for teachers to create a repeat event.
* User verification - to check that all logged in users (teachers) are accredited yoga teachers.
* Ability to select various tags on classes - e.g. outdoor, indoor, online, Zoom, Hatha.. - for easier search and also to make the content of the classes more visually obvious to users.
* Various images showcasing different styles of yoga implemented on the classes cards.
* Visual calendar with classes on.
* FAQ.
* Online booking.
* Online payment.

## Testing

### Validator Testing

### User Stories Testing

### Continuous Testing - Issues and Resolutions to issues found during testing

During the development process, the application was continuously tested and bugs and issues that were found were resolved. A few examples:

* When a logged in user typed in url address looking to get to another user's profile, or the username in the typed url did not exist / user was deleted, they were still sent to their profile page (see the screenshot below). If the user was not logged in and typed a url aiming to get to a profile page, an internal server error was triggered. This was corrected by checking whether the username from the url exists, and whether it matches the username of the logged in user. The user was then redirected appropriately. See example of bug showing username in url not matching logged in user's username below:
![bug showing username in url not matching logged in user's username](docs/readme-img/profile-page-bug.jpg)

### Known Bugs and Issues

There are currently no known bugs or issues present.

## Deployment

### Requirements for Deployment

* GitHub account
* Python
* MongoDB account
* Heroku account

### Heroku Deployment

This project was deployed on Heroku following these steps:

#### Requirements.txt and Procfile

Create these files using these steps in (GitPod) terminal:

1. Type `pip3 freeze -–local > requirements.txt` to create a requirements file (it keeps track of the Python dependencies that we've installed for our project)
2. Type `echo web: python3 run.py > Procfile` to create Procfile (a Heroku-specific type of file that tells Heroku how to run our project)
3. Delete any additional empty lines after the line `web: python app.py`
4. Push these two files into your depository

#### Environment Variables

Create an env.py file with the following information: 

```
import os

os.environ.setdefault("IP", "0.0.0.0")
os.environ.setdefault("PORT", "5000")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", " unique secret key")
os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_URI", " unique uri from mongodb ")
os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_DBNAME", " database name ")
```

As this file contains sensitive information, it needs to be added to the .gitignore file to not be pushed to GitHub

#### Create Heroku App

1. Log in to Heroku
2. Select 'Create New App' from the dashboard
3. Choose an app name (each name has to be unique, if app with that name exists already, a different name will have to be chosen)
4. Select the region based on your location
5. Click 'Create App'
6. Add config vars to Heroku - go to Heroku Settings tab, click on Reveal Config Vars, enter your above described environment variables
7. In your CLI install Heroku by typing `npm install -g heroku`

#### Deploying our App to Heroku

1. Login to Heroku by typing `heroku login -i`
2. Get your app name from Heroku by typing command `heroku apps`
3. Set the Heroku remote (replace the <app_name> with your actual app name): `heroku git:remote -a <app_name>`
4. Add, commit, and push to GitHub (commands `git add .` & `git commit -m "Deploy to Heroku via CLI"`)
5. Push to GitHub `git push origin main`
6. Push to Heroku `git push heroku main`
7. Your Heroku app will be built and you will see your deployed app's URL
