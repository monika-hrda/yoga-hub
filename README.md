# Yoga Hub
_“You are only one yoga class away from a good mood.”_

The app was built as my third milestone project for Code Institute's Full Stack Software Development course. It is a full-stack site that allows its users to manage a common dataset about a yoga domain. The topic for the project was chosen because of my own yoga journey and those of my fellow yoga teachers in training. The app was designed with me/us using it in the future in mind.
