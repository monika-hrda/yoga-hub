# Yoga Hub
_“You are only one yoga class away from a good mood.”_

The web application was built as my third milestone project for Code Institute's Full Stack Software Development course. It is a full-stack site that allows its users to store and manipulate data records about a yoga domain. The topic for the project was chosen because of my own yoga journey and those of my fellow yoga teachers in training. The app was designed with me/us using it in the future in mind. 

You can view the live website [here]( "Yoga Hub").

## User Experience (UX)

### Site Goals

* To provide a place for the yoga community (predominantly in Ireland) to come to to find classes being organised (online or in person) by various yoga teachers.
* To provide a place for yoga teachers to promote their own classes.

### User Stories

As a guest / not logged in user, I want to be able to:

* easily understand what the purpose of the website is.
* navigate the website easily, so that I can find any relevant content.
* view all classes posted on the website.
* find details of any class, as well as find out how to book the class I am interested in.
* search classes based on search terms of my choosing, so that I can find classes suited to me.
* contact the site administrator, so that I can ask any specific questions and get more information.
* view the website clearly on multiple devices, including my mobile device, so that I can achieve my other goals on the go.
* register on the website so that I can create and manage my own classes.

As a registered / logged in user, in addition to the above, I want to be able to:

* log into my account.
* view all classes created by me.
* add a new class.
* edit an existing class of mine.
* delete an existing class of mine.
* get visual feedback when an action on the site is completed.
* log out. 

### Planned Features

* Navigation menu on all pages - changes contents depending on user status
* Home page with information on the site purpose
* Classes displayed and searchable to all users
* User authentication (register, login, logout)
* Profile page listing the logged in user's classes
* CRUD functionality - class creation and management, limited to the class author
* 404 Error page navigating lost users back home
* Responsive design
* MongoDB to store information about users and classes

## Testing

### Validator Testing

### User Stories Testing

### Continuous Testing - Issues and Resolutions to issues found during testing

During the development process, the application was continuously tested and bugs and issues that were found were resolved. A few examples:

* When a logged in user typed in url address looking to get to another user's profile, or the username in the typed url did not exist / user was deleted, they were still sent to their profile page (see the screenshot below). If the user was not logged in and typed a url aiming to get to a profile page, an internal server error was triggered. This was corrected by checking whether the username from the url exists, and whether it matches the username of the logged in user. The user was then redirected appropriately. See example of bug showing username in url not matching logged in user's username below:
