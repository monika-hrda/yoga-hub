# Yoga Hub
_“You are only one yoga class away from a good mood.”_

The web application was built as my third milestone project for Code Institute's Full Stack Software Development course. It is a full-stack site that allows its users to store and manipulate data records about a yoga domain. The topic for the project was chosen because of my own yoga journey and those of my fellow yoga teachers in training. The app was designed with me/us using it in the future in mind. 

You can view the live website [here]( "Yoga Hub").
